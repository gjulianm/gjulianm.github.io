		<h3 class="about-header">About me</h3>

		<p>I'm currently a student in Universidad Aut칩noma de Madrid, finishing my degree in Computer Science &amp; Mathematics. I'm currently working as a developer in Naudit High Performance and Computing and also as a freelancer for other small jobs. I also write about software and technology for <a href="http://xataka.com">Xataka</a> and <a href="http://genbeta.com">Genbeta</a>.</p>

		<p>As a software developer, I specialize in C/C++, C# and Python, although I'm fluent in other languages and technologies, such as Ruby, Bash, LaTeX, Java or Javascript.</p>

		<p>My interests are broad, from parallel computing and low-level networking to the design and development of systems and services. I'm attracted to everything that requires careful thought and innovative solutions.</p>

		<h3 class="about-header">My open source projects</h3>

		<p>I firmly believe in open source software and I try to open source most of the projects I develop. Here are some of them:</p>

		<div class="projects">
			<p><a href="http://ocellapp.com" class="project-link">Ocell</a> This Twitter client started as a test to see what could be done with Windows Phone. Over time, it became a complete client with advanced features, such as multiple columns, advanced filtering or multiple account management.
			</p>

			<p><a href="https://github.com/gjulianm/AncoraMVVM" class="project-link">AncoraMVVM</a> As I started doing more Windows Phone work, I found that the existing MVVM frameworks didn't exactly suit my needs. AncoraMVVM is a framework targeted to the Portable Class Library (PCL) with features that help and speed up Windows Phone development.</p>

			<p><a href="https://github.com/gjulianm/latex_cd" class="project-link">Latex-CD</a> A system to automatically compile and upload LaTeX documents from a git repository, capable of automatically reporting build failures as Github issues. Explained in depth <a href="http://nuncaalaprimera.com/2015/a-continuous-compilation-system-for-latex-files/">in my personal blog.</a>
			</p>

			<p><a href="https://github.com/VicdeJuan/Apuntes" class="project-link">Math - CS notes</a> (In spanish) During my degree in Mathematics and Computer Engineering, some students decided to take notes in LaTeX of our classes and publish them in Github. I've written some of those subjects and contributed to others. I've been also the main developer of the auxiliar LaTeX packages and macros.</p>
